<h2>Parabolic Lift Visualization with InCircle Predicate</h2>

A self-designed project to visualize a projective technique for testing if a query point is inside a circle. We define a unique circle by three points in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$. We then project the three cocircular points and the query point onto a paraboloid in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$. Using the unique plane which passes through our three lifted points, we perform a simple plane-side test on the query point using the determinant of the four points lifted into $$\mathbb{R}^4$$.

<h2>Multivalued Decision Diagram</h2>

A summer project to help me explore the possibility of pursuing the PhD program. The technique for generating constraint satisfaction problem approximations was proposed by Andre A. Cire and Willem-Jan van Hoeve. I began reviewing the work on the recommendation of a professor, and coded up a simple C implementation of an exact MDD which propagates simple linear inequality constraints. While this implementation does not provide the full breadth of features described in the reviewed publications, it does demonstrate the node splitting and filtering propagation algorithms.
