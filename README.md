<h1>Decision Mouse</h1>


<hr>

The origin of my pseudonym Decision Mouse, came to me during a summer independent research project Multivalued Decision Diagrams. For me, it's natural to think of a decision tree as a maze and any valid path from the root to any feasible leaf as the path of some mouse to a piece of cheese. You could also think of solving such problems in parallel with ants, but I think mice are cuter.  A smart mouse would want to get to the cheese as quickly as possible, either because it immediately needs to engage in a session of Tyromancy or just to gorge itself on the delectable dairy.

Anyway, as a recent graduate of the Computer Science & Engineering M.S. program at UConn,  I have taken an interest in hard problems. You know, the problems of the class "those which must not be named." As in life we must struggle in the face of adversity, under the Sword of Damocles that is exponential blow up.

In practice, companies must solve these problems on a daily basis. The most seminal examples from Operations Research are vehicle routing and job scheduling. Formulating instances of these problems is an engineering and design problem which businesses must solve to stay competitive. Given my undergraduate background in Business Administration, it's probably no surprise that I am driven to explore the marriage of these two fields which is Operations Research.
