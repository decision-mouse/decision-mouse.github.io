<h1>Parabolic Lift Visualization with InCircle Predicate</h1>

<h2></h2>
After taking an introductory course in Computational Geometry and enjoying a group project which used a kd-tree visualization, I wanted to try my hand at a personal, self-designed project along the same lines. The original project was in 2D, but I really wanted to try something in 3D. Since I never had the opportunity to take a graphics course, exploring 3D visualization and movement was initially challenging.

Due to time constraints and the breadth of the project, I decided to keep it simple and rely on some libraries to focus more on the task at hand. I've found three.js to be a very welcoming library with all of the functionality I needed.

Pictures have always been my preferred learning vehicle. The Parabolic Lift is a simple idea which marries a few techniques from Linear Algebra. We can uses these techniques to form an InCircle predicate for testing if a point is inside a


This visualization project was part of a semester long project for a Computational Geometry course (Fall 2016).
