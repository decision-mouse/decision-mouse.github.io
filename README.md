<h1>Decision Mouse</h1>


<hr>

The origin of the pseudonym Decision Mouse, came to me during a summer independent research project Multivalued Decision Diagrams. For me, it's natural to think of a decision tree as a maze and any valid path from the root to any feasible leaf as the path of some mouse to a piece of cheese. You could also think of solving such problems in parallel with ants, but I think mice are cuter.  A smart mouse would want to get to the cheese as quickly as possible, either because it urgently needs to engage in a session of Tyromancy or just to gorge itself on the delectable dairy.

Anyways, I recently graduated from the Computer Science & Engineering master's program at the University of Connecticut. Originally, my bachelor's degree was a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of Southern Maine. Now, I understand why you might be scratching your head a little, please allow me to explain: In 2013, I decided to transition to engineering, and I have spent the last four years immersing myself in the field of Computer Science. At UConn I was able to take all of the requisite undergraduate courses that would allow me to quickly transition into the master's program which I accomplished in 2.5 years and finished my master's in 1.5 years.

Due to my background in customer facing roles, I was a successful TA for several semester. These soft skills have also enabled me to be successful in several team projects. However, don't let my background pigeon hole me too much, I'd like to think I am an engineer through and through. During my time at UConn, I took an interest in hard problems. You know, the problems of the class "those which must not be named." As in life, we must struggle in the face of adversity, under the Sword of Damocles that is exponential blow up. I do not fear these problems (but I do respect them), because I have training with tools for how to handle them.

Topics which I've had the pleasure of studying include Computational Geometry, Machine Learning, Discrete Optimization, and Distributed Systems.

I am looking for a position as a software engineer in any of the following fields:
* Resource Management
* Machine Learning
* Distributed Systems & Cloud Computing
* Collaborative Online Technologies
* Interactive Visual Software

I'm very interested in relocating from the east coast to the west coast, and can organize a move quickly for those that need urgently need a position filled.

Some of my strong points:
* Fast learner: I'm willing to put the time in to understand something new.
* Open Minded: Sometimes, I think I'm right, and I'm not. I get that, let's figure it out together.
* Strong Communication: Synchronization is key for any distributed system, including people.
* Organized: Since I have some experience with accounting concepts, I appreciate good book keeping.
