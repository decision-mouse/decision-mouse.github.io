<h2>Parabolic Lift Visualization with InCircle Predicate</h2>

A self-designed project to visualize a projective technique for testing if a point is inside a circle. A unique circle is defined by three points in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$. We then project the three points of the circle and the query point into $$\mathbb{R}^3$$. Using the unique plane which passes through our three lifted points, we perform a simple plane-side test on the query point using the determinant of the four points lifted into $$\mathbb{R}^4$$.

<h2>Multivalued Decision Diagram </h2>

A summer project to help me explore the possibility of going into the PhD program. This technique for generating constraint satisfaction problem approximations was proposed by Andre A. Cire and Willem-Jan van Hoeve. I began reviewing the work and coded up a C implementation of an exact MDD. While this implementation does not provide the full breadth of features described in the reviewed publications, it does demonstrate the state splitting and filtering propagation algorithms.
